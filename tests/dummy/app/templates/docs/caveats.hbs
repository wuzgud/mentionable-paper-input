<h1 class="docs-md__h1">Caveats</h1>

<p class="docs-md">
  There are a few things to keep in mind before you install the addon and while you're developing:
  <ul class="original">
    <li>
      As its name implies, Mentionable Paper Input is dependent on the
      <a href="http://miguelcobain.github.io/ember-paper">ember-paper library</a> and is required to use MPI.
    </li>
    <li>
      For now, the mentions dropdown list only supports a maximum of 6 visible mentions.
      Scrolling is disabled on the dropdown element as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      Depending on text length and combination of specific characters the user enters, mention styling on certain
      mobile devices and browsers can look "off" or inconsistent at times.
      This issue is rare but can hurt the overall user experience. You can conditionally apply the
      <code class="inline-snippet">disableStyling</code> flag at mobile screen sizes as a way to bypass the issue.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="docs-md docs-mt-4 docs-mb-4">
  We will continue to work to improve the developer and user experience of the addon and intend to address these and
  other issues in future versions. We are always accepting
  <a href="https://github.com/wuzgud/mentionable-paper-input/pulls">pull-requests</a> for features, enhancements,
  and/or bug fixes.
